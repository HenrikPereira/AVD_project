# Project Analyzing and Visualizing Data
### Entreprise Data Science & Analytics (2019)
_______________________

This project is intended to be a use case for the class Analyzing and Visualizing Data.

The problem to be solved by this project, is to allow our client to have a dynamically updated Power BI Dashboard that 
can help him, or others, to advice on the best choice of a car, according to available data and the needs of the client.

The scope of said dashboard is limited to only one dealer, of many brands, based in Portugal.
